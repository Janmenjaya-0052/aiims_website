== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

= How to import files in WordPress =

The most straightforward method for file import is through direct upload to WordPress. Alternatively, use import tools located under Tools > Import/Export or a plugin. If the plugin is installed, access the CSV importer menu for seamless WordPress import and export. Support for various file formats, including XML and CSV.

= Why CSV and XML Format for WordPress Importer =

* The CSV method empowers users with basic Excel or spreadsheet knowledge to visually audit, change, edit, or update bulk data before importing. This offline approach minimizes manual work and saves time.

* Editing XML demands a basic understanding of the structure. Otherwise, users are restricted to importing without making changes to the source file.

Choose between CSV and XML with the WordPress CSV Importer plugin. Import and export Posts, Pages, Custom Posts, WooCommerce, and various post types to and from WordPress.

= How to use this CSV and XML WordPress Importer  =
* Utilize the export option to export existing content records from WordPress. Create a base sample CSV or XML file, or use it as a template for building your import file.
* Seamlessly edit and update the export file for reimporting.
* Add new fields with values to existing posts using the import file.
* Or add more posts according to your needs.
* Opt for the update option by selecting existing items during import. This updates/replaces values based on mapping setups.


= How to import WordPress site from localhost =

For users of XAMPP or WAMP, exporting from the export tab after development and customization is feasible. Use advanced filters to trim content, excluding unwanted or unfinished items, before importing to a remote host.

You can also use this method when building new sites, developing them in localhost, and needing access to existing content on the old server.

This is also useful if you have moved your site to another server or hosting and want to move it back.


= How to validate a CSV file for issues? =

Importing your CSV may fail if you miss escaping characters or misplace/skip characters. Any CSV file should be checked for errors or warnings before being imported into WordPress. You can validate a CSV file using a free tool CSV Lint to identify issues and where to fix them exactly.

= What is an XML file? =

An XML document is a basic unit of XML information, consisting of elements and other markups in an orderly package. An XML document contains a wide variety of data.

= Can I get any demo data or sample files for testing the import? =

Get [example CSV files from here to start testing import](https://www.smackcoders.com/blog/wordpress-ultimate-csv-importer-csv-sample-files-and-updates.html?utm_source=web&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=wp_org) with CSV Import.

= WordPress posts not showing after import, Why and how to fix this? =

This could rarely happen for reasons like,
1. Mandatory fields have no values.
2. wp_debug value is set to True.

You could avoid this error by providing values to the mandatory fields and setting False to wp_debug in the wp_config file.

= Why does the media library fail to import using the Export-Import WordPress plugin? That is not importing all images to WordPress media, no files found? =

The failure may be due to,
1. Unsupported image formats.
2. The image is not publicly downloadable (permission issue).
3. The domain or URL doesn't exist or isn't secured (SSL issues).

= How to import WordPress posts with images? =

To do this, add a separate column for featured images in your import file and mention the image URL as a value. Or declare the inline images inside the post_content and provide the image URL using the HTML tag inside the post_content.

= How to import all external images in WordPress? =

In the Media Handling section of the WordPress Importer plugin, just enable the **Download Post-Content External Images to Media** option. This will import all the images from Google Images, Pexels, Pixabay, Dropbox, etc., directly to your WordPress media library. Check [Media Handling in WordPress Importer documentation](https://www.smackcoders.com/documentation/wp-ultimate-csv-importer-pro/how-to-import-schedule-or-update?utm_source=web&utm_medium=wp_org&utm_campaign=readme) for more information.

= How to Import WordPress with already existing post content without duplicating it? =

You can import the same post content without duplicating using the update method using the wordpress csv import tool. After uploading the file, select the **Existing items** option. Followed by other steps, in the **Import Configuration Section** click on Update to update the newly imported data inside your existing WordPress Posts.


= How long does WordPress import take? =

Typically, the speed and performance are influenced by your server speed, memory capacity, and file size. You can track the completion time of import in the **Import Configuration section** screen.

For more detailed FAQ answers, please visit the [FAQ article for CSV Import](https://www.smackcoders.com/documentation/wp-ultimate-csv-importer-pro/importer-faq?utm_source=web&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=wp_org).

= How to import and export WordPress posts? =

1. To export posts, go to the Export tab and select **Posts**. Provide a file name and select one file type. Click Export and download the file to your local device. This exported file can serve as a sample for creating a new file or for importing the data to another WordPress site using CSV Importer.

2. To import posts, go to the **import/update** section and upload your prepared CSV or XML file.

= How to import a Word document into WordPress =

If you have a Word document to import into WordPress, follow these steps:

There are no viable solutions or plugins available to directly import the docx or docs file to WordPress. Instead, you can use a tool or plugin to convert them into a post. Note that this applies only to a single post.

Alternatively, there are three possible ways to do this manually by copying and pasting content from docs,
1. The first possibility to do that using Classic editor, go to Pages > Add New. Simply copy and paste the content as one post at a time.
2. For the Gutenberg editor, copy and paste the content to create blocks one at a time.
3. Else you can embed a Word document using a plugin.

= How to export WP Users? =
Make sure the export addon is installed and activated in WordPress. Then, navigate to the plugin export tab to export WP Users.
